# Novation Launchkey 25 Mk2

Bitwig controller extension for the Launchkey 25 Mk2.

## Prerequisites

Developed and tested with Bitwig Studio 6.0.

## Tips

You can adjust the velocity sensitivity by holding in the InControl key and at the same time press the rewind, fast forward, stop or play buttons. This is standard functionality of the Launchkey, but something that threw me off at first.
